jQuery provides a wide range of methods to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM). Here is a list of some of the most commonly used DOM manipulation methods in jQuery:

1. **Selecting Elements**:
   - `$(selector)`: Selects elements based on a CSS selector.
   - `$(element)`: Wraps a single DOM element or HTML string into a jQuery object.

2. **Manipulating Content**:
   - `.html()`: Gets or sets the HTML contents of the selected elements.
   - `.text()`: Gets or sets the text contents of the selected elements.
   - `.append()`: Appends content to the inside of the selected elements.
   - `.prepend()`: Prepends content to the inside of the selected elements.
   - `.before()`: Inserts content before the selected elements.
   - `.after()`: Inserts content after the selected elements.
   - `.remove()`: Removes the selected elements from the DOM.

3. **Manipulating Attributes and Properties**:
   - `.attr()`: Gets or sets attributes of the selected elements.

   - `.toggleClass()`: Toggles between adding/removing classes from the selected elements.

4. **Traversing the DOM**:
   - `.find()`: Gets descendants of the selected elements.
   - `.parent()`: Gets the direct parent of the selected elements.
   - `.children()`: Gets the immediate children of the selected elements.
   - `.siblings()`: Gets the siblings of the selected elements.
   - `.closest()`: Gets the first ancestor of the selected elements that matches a selector.

5. **Event Handling**:
   - `.on()`: Attaches event handlers to the selected elements.
   - `.off()`: Removes event handlers from the selected elements.
   - `.trigger()`: Triggers a specific event on the selected elements.

6. **CSS Manipulation**:
   - `.css()`: Gets or sets CSS properties of the selected elements.
   - `.addClass()`, `.removeClass()`, `.toggleClass()`: Manipulate classes to change CSS styles.

7. **Animation**:
   - `.fadeIn()`, `.fadeOut()`, `.fadeToggle()`: Fade elements in/out.
   - `.slideUp()`, `.slideDown()`, `.slideToggle()`: Slide elements up/down.


8. **Dimensions and Position**:
   - `.width()`, `.height()`: Get or set the width or height of elements.
   - `.innerWidth()`, `.innerHeight()`: Get the inner width or height of elements (including padding).
   - `.outerWidth()`, `.outerHeight()`: Get the outer width or height of elements (including padding and border).
   - `.offset()`: Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the document.
   - `.position()`: Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the offset parent.

9. **Manipulating Data**:
   - `.data()`: Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements.
   - `.removeData()`: Remove a previously-stored piece of data.

10. **Form Manipulation**:
    - `.serialize()`: Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission.
    - `.serializeArray()`: Encode a set of form elements as an array of names and values.
    - `.val()`: Get or set the value of form elements.

11. **Effects**:
    - `.hide()`, `.show()`: Hide or show elements.
    - `.toggle()`: Toggle between hiding and showing elements.
    - `.slideUp()`, `.slideDown()`: Slide elements up or down.
    - `.animate()`: Perform a custom animation on elements.

12. **Utilities**:
    - `$.each()`: Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element.
    - `$.grep()`: Finds the elements of an array that meet a condition and returns a new array.
    - `$.map()`: Transforms an array of objects into an array of different objects.

13. **Ajax**:
    - `$.ajax()`: Perform an asynchronous HTTP request.
    - `$.get()`, `$.post()`, `$.getJSON()`: Shorthand methods for common Ajax requests.

14. **Deferred Objects**:
    - `$.Deferred()`: Create a new deferred object.
    - `.done()`, `.fail()`, `.always()`: Add handlers to be called when the Deferred object is resolved, rejected, or either.

Here are some more jQuery methods for DOM manipulation and other common tasks:

15. **Clone Elements**:
    - `.clone()`: Create a deep copy of the set of matched elements.

16. **Filtering**:
    - `.filter()`: Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test.
    - `.not()`: Remove elements from the set of matched elements.

17. **Finding Elements**:
    - `.eq()`: Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index.
    - `.first()`, `.last()`: Reduce the set of matched elements to the first or last in the set.
    - `.slice()`: Reduce the set of matched elements to a subset specified by a range of indices.

18. **Miscellaneous**:
    - `.each()`: Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element.
    - `.delay()`: Set a timer to delay execution of subsequent items in the queue.
    - `.index()`: Search for a given element from among the matched elements and return its index.

19. **Utilities**:
    - `$.extend()`: Merge the contents of two or more objects together into the first object.
    - `$.trim()`: Remove whitespace from the beginning and end of a string.

20. **Event Handling**:
    - `.bind()`, `.unbind()`: Attach or remove event handlers.
    - `.one()`: Attach a handler to an event for the elements that will execute at most once.

21. **Deferred Objects**:
    - `$.when()`: Provides a way to execute callback functions based on one or more objects, usually Deferred objects that represent asynchronous events.

22. **Effects**:
    - `.stop()`: Stop the currently running animation on the matched elements.
Here are some more jQuery methods for various tasks:

23. **Visibility**:
    - `.is()`: Check the current matched set of elements against a selector, element, or jQuery object and return true if at least one of these elements matches the given arguments.
    - `.toggle()` (with parameters): Display or hide the matched elements with a sliding motion.

24. **Scrolling**:
    - `.scrollTop()`: Get the current vertical position of the scroll bar for the first element in the set of matched elements or set the vertical position of the scroll bar for every matched element.
    - `.scrollLeft()`: Get the current horizontal position of the scroll bar for the first element in the set of matched elements or set the horizontal position of the scroll bar for every matched element.

25. **Attribute Manipulation**:
    - `.removeAttr()`: Remove an attribute from each element in the set of matched elements.
    - `.prop()`: Get the value of a property for the first element in the set of matched elements or set one or more properties for every matched element.

26. **Form Handling**:
    - `.serialize()`: Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission.
    - `.serializeArray()`: Encode a set of form elements as an array of names and values.

27. **Document Ready**:
    - `$(document).ready()`: Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded.

28. **Error Handling**:
    - `.error()`: Bind an event handler to the "error" JavaScript event.

30. **Miscellaneous**:
    - `$.noConflict()`: Relinquish jQuery's control of the `$` variable.

These methods cover a wide range of functionality for DOM manipulation, event handling, animation, and more. They are designed to make JavaScript development easier and more efficient for web developers.

These methods cover a wide range of tasks, from basic DOM manipulation to event handling, animations, and more advanced utilities. They are designed to simplify common web development tasks and make it easier to work with the DOM and JavaScript.
